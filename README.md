## Problem Overview

Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is a critical condition that affects individuals with Type 1 Diabetes, potentially leading to severe complications if not detected early. Traditional monitoring methods require invasive blood sampling, which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable for patients.

**HypoPredict** addresses this challenge by:
- Leveraging **non-invasive ECG signals** to predict hypoglycemic events
- Using **physiological features** (heart rate, breathing patterns, activity levels) extracted from wearable sensors
- Providing **early warnings** to prevent dangerous glucose drops
- Enabling **continuous monitoring** without repeated blood sampling

The system analyzes time-series data from the D1NAMO dataset, which contains ECG, glucose, acceleration, and breathing measurements from Type 1 Diabetic patients.

## Package Structure

The HypoPredict package is organized into the following components:

### Key Components:

- **Data Handling**: `chunker.py`, `chunk_preproc.py`, `labeler.py` - Process raw sensor data into labeled chunks
- **Feature Engineering**: `feature_extraction.py`, `new_features.py` - Extract physiological features from ECG and sensor data
- **Models**: `fusion/`, `daniel_model/` - Individual ML models and fusion ensemble
- **API**: `api/` - FastAPI server for model inference

## Model Architecture

HypoPredict uses a **fusion modeling approach** that combines multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve robust predictions:

### Individual Models:

1. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting for tabular features
2. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** - Pattern recognition in feature space
3. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** - Instance-based learning
4. **CNN+LSTM** - Deep learning for sequential ECG patterns
   - Convolutional layers extract local patterns from ECG signals
   - LSTM layers capture temporal dependencies
   - Focal loss handles class imbalance
   - Architecture: LSTM → Conv1D → BatchNorm → MaxPooling → GlobalAvgPooling → Dense

### Fusion Strategy:

The fusion model combines predictions from all individual models using a meta-learner approach:
- Each base model generates predicted probabilities for hypoglycemic events
- The fusion model learns optimal weights to combine these predictions
- This ensemble approach improves robustness and generalization

### Model Features:

- **Time-series chunking**: Overlapping windows of sensor data
- **Feature extraction**: Heart rate variability, ECG morphology, breathing patterns
- **Class imbalance handling**: Focal loss and recursive undersampling
- **Temporal aggregation**: Rolling median and moving averages for smooth predictions

## Data Handling

### Cross-Validation System

HypoPredict implements a **custom cross-validation splitter** (`cv.py`) that:
- Preserves within-day temporal patterns (no random shuffling within days)
- Shuffles days within patients for robust validation
- Shuffles between patients for generalization
- Ensures each split contains at least one hypoglycemic event
- Supports configurable n-fold splits

This approach is critical for time-series medical data where temporal ordering matters.

### Recursive Undersampling

To handle severe class imbalance (hypoglycemic events are rare):
- **Undersampling** majority class (normal glucose) while preserving all minority samples
- **Recursive approach** maintains temporal coherence
- **Stratified splitting** ensures balanced representation across folds
- **Validation checks** confirm adequate representation of hypoglycemic events

### Data Pipeline:

1. **Load**: Import raw sensor data for patients and days
2. **Chunk**: Create overlapping time windows (configurable size and step)
3. **Label**: Identify hypoglycemic events and assign labels to chunks
4. **Extract**: Engineer features from raw signals
5. **Preprocess**: Scale, normalize, and prepare for model input
6. **Split**: Create train/validation/test sets with custom CV

## FastAPI Integration

HypoPredict includes a **FastAPI server** (`api/fast.py`) for real-time predictions and system integration:

### Endpoints:

- `GET /` - Health check and welcome message
- `POST /predict_from_url` - Predict from Google Drive-hosted data
- `GET /predict_fusion_local_83` - Demo predictions for patient 83
- `GET /predict_fusion_local_64` - Demo predictions for patient 64

### Features:

- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests
- **Pre-loaded models** for fast inference
- **Batch predictions** with temporal aggregation
- **Multiple model support** (individual and fusion)
- **Google Drive integration** for data loading
- **Dockerized deployment** ready
